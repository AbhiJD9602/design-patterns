Creational Design Pattern

Singleton :- The Singleton Design Pattern aims to keep a check on initialization of objects of a particular class by ensuring that only one instance of the object exists throughout the Java Virtual Machine.

Factory:-  This pattern “defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses”.

Abstract Factory:- Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Builder:- When the complexity of creating object increases, the Builder pattern can separate out the instantiation process by using another object (a builder) to construct the object.

Object Pool:- Object pool pattern is a software creational design pattern which is used in situations where the cost of initializing a class instance is very high.

Prototype:- A prototype is a template of any object before the actual object is constructed. In java also, it holds the same meaning. Prototype design pattern is used in scenarios where application needs to create a number of instances of a class, which has almost same state or differs very little.
